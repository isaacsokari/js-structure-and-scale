# Project: Places - Accessibility Audit

In today’s project, we’re going to conduct an accessibility audit on an app that lets users find and “favorite” interesting places in the state of Rhode Island (in the United States of America).

## The Template

The template for this project includes an HTML file for the landing page (index.html), as well as HTML files for each of the places you can visit (cliff-walk.html, waterfire.html, and so on).

A shared style.css file and index.js file are loaded on every HTML file.

The JavaScript file injects a “Favorite” button into the [data-controls] element on each of the place detail pages, and adds a heart emoji (♥) next to any favorited place on the homepage (index.html).

For this project, dig into the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and fix any accessibility issues you come across.

Note: Documentation for this project is deliberately light, to give you some experience making sense of a code base you didn’t write yourself. It may be helpful to browse the app with a screen reader enabled.
